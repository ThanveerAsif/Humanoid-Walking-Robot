# Humanoid-Walking-Robot
This is a small project to play with servo motors interfaced with NodeMCU ESP8266. Four servo motors are used. Two for hands and two for legs. The servo motors are programmed in such a way that the robot moves forward. The angle of the servo motors are changed as per our movement requirement.
